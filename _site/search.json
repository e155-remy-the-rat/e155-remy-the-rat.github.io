    "text": "We have recreated Remy the Rat from Ratatouille! For those who have not seen the movie, Remy is a rat that sits on the head of a chef and controls the arm and hand movements of the chef to cook in a restaurant. The video below, taken from the movie, shows the type of movements we are trying to recreate:\n\n\n\nRemy teaches Linguini how to cook\n\n\nWe have slightly adjusted this to create a rat that reads signals from IMUs connected to the user’s arms, and subsequently moves the rat’s arms to match! This gives the illusion of the rat controlling the user, with four different positions of Remy’s. See the video below to see how we did:\nIn order to implement this design, IMUs track the position of the user’s arms and communicate with a microcontroller on the user’s body. The resulting state is transmitted to a microcontroller and FPGA on the top of the user’s head that control motors linked to Remy’s arms. A block diagram of this implementation is shown below."

The I2C peripheral was a feature of the microcontroller that was not explored during the E155 labs.\nIn order to implement this protocol, drivers were written from scratch that implemented I2C peripheral configuration, I2C reading, and I2C writing. For more information on implementation, refer to the MCU page."

The FPGA takes in the states from the second MCU through 4 GPIO pins and drives PWM signals to the motors to move them to a distinct state. The 2 Most Significant Bits of the state variable drive the left motor, while the 2 Least Significant Bits drive the right motor. Thus, each motor has 4 distinct states. For more information, see the FPGA page."

    "text": "This project uses two MCUs to handle both the reading of IMU data and the transmission of state information. The first MCU on the chef jacket reads acceleration and gyroscope data from the 2 IMUs mounted on the user’s arms through I2C. It also processes the data to then extrapolate state information for the arm movements. Lastly, this IMU writes state data through SPI to the first RF module to then transmit to the second RF module.\nThe second MCU reads data from the second RF module to receive state information for the movement of the arms. This MCU then sends the state information to the FPGA through GPIO.\n\nInput\n\nReceives signals from the IMU via I2C: a new feature for processing IMU signals.\n\nProcessing\n\nProcesses IMU data (also new!) to:\n\nDetermine motor actions.\nDecide the state to be transmitted.\n\n\nOutput\n\nSends signals or states to the RF chip via SPI.
